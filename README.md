# Biggest_square by ikerpacheco

The objective of this project is to find the biggest square possible in a map given by the user. It was one of my first projects, that's why the code is worse than in other projects.

### HOW TO RUN

- Clone the repository.
- Compile it by typing "make re".
- Run it by typing "./bsq map".

----------------------------------
### MAP

It shoould contain:
- '.' for available spaces.
- 'o' for obstacles.

Here is an example:

### RESULT

Taking the map passed as argument, the program will scan it and search for the biggest square possible without touching obstacles. Marking it with 'x'.

NOTE: It seems like a rectangle visually, but it is a square. Count the rows and the columns if you don't believe me!
